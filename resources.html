                        <button class="faq-question">What is a caregiver referral service?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A caregiver referral service, or registry, acts as a matchmaker connecting families directly with professional, independent caregivers. Unlike a traditional home care agency where caregivers are employees of the company, our service empowers you to become the employer. We handle the intensive work of sourcing, screening, and vetting qualified candidates, presenting you with a selection of caregivers who match your specific needs and preferences. This model provides you with greater control, consistency, and a direct relationship with your chosen caregiver.</p>

                        <button class="faq-question">How is this different from a traditional agency?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>The key differences lie in control, cost, and consistency. With a referral service, you hire directly, giving you full control over care schedules, daily tasks, and compensation. This direct-employer model eliminates agency overhead, often resulting in <strong>30-40% cost savings</strong> for families. Furthermore, it fosters a more stable and personal relationship with your caregiver, reducing the turnover that is common with agency-assigned staff. While online marketplaces leave you to vet candidates on your own, we provide the professional screening and ongoing support to ensure a safe and successful match.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Our proprietary vetting process is designed to ensure the highest standards of safety, skill, and professionalism. Every candidate undergoes a multi-step evaluation:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Experience Verification:</strong> A thorough review of their professional history and qualifications.</li>
                                <li><strong>In-Depth Interviews:</strong> A behavioral interview with our team to assess their expertise, communication skills, and compassionate approach.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reference Checks:</strong> We speak directly with previous employers to confirm reliability, integrity, and performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Background Coordination:</strong> Before a final offer is made, we coordinate a comprehensive third-party background check, including criminal records and driving history.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>As a household employer, you are responsible for managing payroll, withholding taxes (Social Security, Medicare), and securing a workers' compensation insurance policy. While this may sound complex, we simplify it completely. We partner with industry-leading payroll services like <strong>HomePay by Care.com</strong>, which automate all tax filings, payroll processing, and compliance. They make managing the financial side of employment effortless, allowing you to focus on the care itself.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Our pricing structure is transparent and designed for value. You pay a <strong>one-time referral fee</strong> for our comprehensive search and vetting service. This fee covers the entire process of finding and matching you with a qualified caregiver. The caregiver's hourly rate is then paid directly to them, without any ongoing agency markups. This direct-pay model is the primary driver of the significant cost savings our clients experience compared to traditional agencies.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Your long-term satisfaction is our highest priority. We pride ourselves on making exceptional matches, but we understand that the ideal fit is crucial. That's why we offer a <strong>90-day replacement guarantee</strong>. If, for any reason, the relationship with your caregiver does not meet your expectations within the first 90 days, we will conduct a new, comprehensive search to find a better match at no additional referral cost to you.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes! Most long-term care insurance policies cover in-home care provided by independent caregivers. Because you are the employer in this model, you can typically submit claims directly to your insurance provider for reimbursement. We can guide you through the process and provide the necessary documentation to make filing claims straightforward.</p>

                            <p>Our typical timeline from initial consultation to caregiver placement is <strong>2-3 weeks</strong>, though this can vary based on your specific needs and scheduling preferences. We maintain a curated network of pre-vetted caregivers, which allows us to move quickly while never compromising on quality. For urgent situations, we can often expedite the process.</p>
